# **Python & Data Science Foundations â€“ Guided Course**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains my work from a **Guided course in Machine Learning & Data Science** under the mentorship of my professor.  

It covers **Python programming, numerical computing, data handling, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** â€” foundational skills required for Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects.  

The repo is organized **week-by-week**, gradually building from Python basics to advanced ML workflows.
